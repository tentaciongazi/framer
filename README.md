## 🎯 What is this?

You know when you want to share a screenshot on Twitter or LinkedIn but it looks plain and boring? Framer wraps it in a beautiful frame with a gradient background, shadow, and macOS-style window chrome — in seconds.

**Before vs After:**
```
boring white screenshot  →  🌊 gradient background + macOS frame + shadow
```

Used by developers, designers, and indie makers to make their work look polished when sharing online.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **9 backgrounds** — 6 gradients + 3 solid colors
- 🖥️ **3 frame styles** — macOS, Simple, None
- 📐 **Adjustable padding** — control the spacing
- 🌍 **5 languages** — English, Turkish, Spanish, French, German
- 📥 **PNG export** — high quality, ready to share
- ⚡ **Zero install** — single HTML file, runs in browser
- 🔒 **100% private** — nothing leaves your computer

## 🚀 Usage

**Option 1 — Just download and open:**
1. Download `framer.html`
2. Double-click it
3. Done — it opens in your browser

**Option 2 — Clone:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tentaciongazi/framer.git
```
Then open `framer.html` in your browser.

No Node.js. No `npm install`. No server. Just one file.

## 🛠️ How it works

Everything runs in the browser using the **Canvas API** — no server, no external service, no API key needed.

1. You drop a screenshot
2. Canvas draws the background gradient
3. Canvas draws the window frame on top
4. Canvas places your screenshot inside
5. You download the result as PNG

Your images never leave your computer.
